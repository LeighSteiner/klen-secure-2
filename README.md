work in progress, a new version of klen-secure, currently available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/klen-secure

features/goals to  come in VERSION 2:

* cleaner code (indents/variable declaration/log clean-up, try-catch blocks -- possible non async-await version to be back compatible with earlier Node.js) 

* better usage examples in the readme

* koa compatibility (https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-passport)

* combining user clearance assignment/auth fail log into  one function so that there's less of my code in your code! 

* no more single route secure

* no more signout middleware 

* more data rich fail log -- dates, times, IP addresses?
